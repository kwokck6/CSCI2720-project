# CSCI2720-project
CSCI2720 Project - Introduction to Web Applications

## Purpose
- To serve as a hands-on exercise for using Node.js/Express and MongoDB.
- To remake the project using Flask and PyMongo.

Note: Due to copyright reasons, the remade version is slightly modified from the original project specification, but the gist is the same.

## Requirements
- User actions:
  - list events in a tables and allow sorting with one of the listed fields
  - search for events which contain certain keywords in one field chosen by user
  - separate view for each single event, containing the event details and non-threaded comments
  - Add events into favourite events
  - reload from online dataset
  - CRUD event data in local database
  - See username in the top right of screen and able to log out
- The app must be a single page application.

## Original performance
The original project is not successful due to lack of communication between groupmates. The project is instead submitted separately.
