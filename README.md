# CSCI2720-project
CSCI2720 Project - Introduction to Web Applications

## Purpose
- To serve as a hands-on exercise for using Node.js/Express and MongoDB.
- To remake the project using Flask and PyMongo.

Note: Due to copyright reasons, the requirements of the remade version is slightly modified from the original project specification, but the gist is the same.

## Original requirements
- User actions:
  - list events in a tables and allow sorting with one of the listed fields
  - search for events which contain certain keywords in one field chosen by user
  - separate view for each single event, containing the event details and non-threaded comments
  - add events into favourite events
  - reload from online dataset
  - CRUD event data in local database
  - see username in the top right-hand corner of the screen and able to log out
- Non-user actions:
  - log in to use the app
- The app must be a single page application.

## Original performance
The original project is incomplete due to insufficient communication between groupmates. The project is instead submitted in separate parts.

## Remade version
The remade version now consists of multi-page version both built with Flask and MongoDB.
A complete single page application will be uploaded later.

## To do list
- [x] Upload original incomplete version (as comparison)
- [ ] Remake original version using Node.js/Express
- [ ] Create a SPA version using Flask
- [x] Create a multi-page version using Flask
